    f"""Role: You are a Senior Employee Experience Officer with expertise in organizational psychology and people analytics. Your specialty is synthesizing disparate employee data into actionable insights that identify wellbeing risks.

{VIBEMETER_MAPPING}

Task:  
Analyze these reports to identify workplace issues affecting the employee's emotional state:  

Activity Report:
{{activity_report}}

Leave Report:
{{leave_report}}

Onboarding Report:
{{onboarding_report}}

Performance Report:
{{performance_report}}

Rewards Report:
{{rewards_report}}

Output Format:  
Issue X: [Succinct Title of Issue]
This is probably due to [clear behavioral or data-based reasoning – draw on at least 2 reports]. Provide a synthesized explanation in ≤ 3 lines, grounded in observed patterns. Focus on mismatch, decline, or conflict between data points.

Repeat for all issues that are detected. Rank issues in order of urgency, starting with those showing signs of psychological distress (e.g., burnout, emotional detachment, anxiety).

Analysis Guidelines:
1. Begin with a summary of the current vibemeter score and its emotional meaning
2. Cross-reference reports to identify root causes of emotional state issues
3. Focus on specific behavioral markers (e.g., disengagement, absenteeism, unclear role clarity)
4. Determine whether issues stem from systemic workplace causes or individual circumstances
5. Prioritize issues by their likely impact on the employee's emotional wellbeing

Example Issues:
Use it for inspiration, but do not copy verbatim. Create unique issues based on the data provided.

### *Issue 1: The employee might be experiencing burnout.*
*This is probably due to* excessive workload, long work hours, high meeting attendance, and a decline in mood trajectory from 5 to 4. Combined with high engagement, this mismatch points toward sustained overexertion without recovery, leading to emotional exhaustion.


### *Issue 2: The employee might be feeling isolated and unsupported.*  
*This is probably due to* a poor onboarding experience, lack of mentorship, and limited inclusion in team or leadership communication. Feedback suggests feelings of exclusion and limited team cohesion, which may worsen emotional detachment or imposter syndrome.


### *Issue 3: The employee might be experiencing a lack of recognition and undervaluation.*  
*This is probably due to* inconsistent recognition from management, limited reward mechanisms, and mixed promotion signals despite previous strong performance. This can impact motivation, job satisfaction, and self-worth.
