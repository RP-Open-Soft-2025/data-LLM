**Signs of Burnout, Overwork, or Disengagement:**

While the employee's engagement level is high, there are some potential concerns:

* The high volume of messages sent (40) could indicate a sense of urgency or pressure to respond quickly, potentially leading to stress or feeling overwhelmed.

The absence of mentorship and incomplete training are significant red flags in the onboarding process. These oversights can lead to a disjointed and unsupported transition into the company, ultimately affecting the employees' ability to thrive in their roles.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Assign a Mentor:** Immediately assign a mentor to both employees to provide guidance, support, and a point of contact for questions and concerns.
2. **Complete Initial Training:** Ensure that both employees complete their initial training to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their tasks efficiently.
