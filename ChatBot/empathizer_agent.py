        First, use the following reasoning steps to determine if empathy is needed:
        
        Step 1: Identify the emotions present in the employee's last message. What feelings are they expressing?
        Step 2: Assess the intensity of these emotions. Are they expressing strong negative or vulnerable emotions?
        Step 3: Determine if the employee is sharing a personal challenge, difficulty, or vulnerability.
        Step 4: Consider if acknowledging these emotions would help the employee feel heard and understood.
        Step 5: Based on steps 1-4, decide if an empathetic response is needed (Yes/No).
        
        If your answer to Step 5 is "No", respond with ONLY the text "NO_EMPATHY_NEEDED".
        
        If your answer to Step 5 is "Yes", then:

        **IMPORTANT**: If empathy is really not needed, don't generate anything.

        Generate a very brief empathetic response (1 sentence) that acknowledges their feelings
        and creates a safe space. Your response should be warm and supportive, showing that you 
        understand what they're experiencing.
        
        Do NOT offer solutions or advice - just empathize with their situation and emotions.
